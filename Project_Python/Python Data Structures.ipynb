    "#### What Are the Basic Data Structures in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python provides several built-in data structures that are used to store collections of data. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. List: An ordered collection of items which can be of different types. Lists are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3, \"four\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Tuple: An ordered collection of items which can be of different types. Tuples are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, \"four\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Set: An unordered collection of unique items. Sets are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Dictionary: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_dict = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. String: A sequence of characters. Strings are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What Are Mutable and Immutable Data Structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mutable Data Structures: These are data structures that can be modified after creation. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    my_list.append(4)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Immutable Data Structures: These are data structures that cannot be modified after creation. Examples include strings, tuples, and frozensets.Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "    # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Choose the Right Data Structure in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific needs of your application. Consider the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Access Speed:\n",
    "            Lists provide O(1) time complexity for indexing.\n",
    "            Dictionaries provide O(1) time complexity for key lookup.\n",
    "        Insertion and Deletion:\n",
    "            Lists have O(n) time complexity for insertion and deletion in the worst case.\n",
    "            Sets and dictionaries have O(1) time complexity for insertion and deletion.\n",
    "        Order:\n",
    "            Lists and tuples maintain the order of elements.\n",
    "            Sets and dictionaries (in Python 3.7+) maintain insertion order, but typically sets are considered unordered collections.\n",
    "        Uniqueness:\n",
    "            Sets ensure all elements are unique.\n",
    "            Lists and tuples allow duplicate elements.\n",
    "        Mutability:\n",
    "            If you need to modify the data structure after creation, use mutable structures like lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "            For fixed collections of items, use immutable structures like tuples or frozensets.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Are Data Structures Available in the collections Module?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The collections module in Python provides several additional data structures that are designed to handle specific use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. namedtuple(): Factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from collections import namedtuple\n",
    "    Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])\n",
    "    p = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. deque: A list-like container with fast appends and pops on both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from collections import deque\n",
    "    d = deque([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    d.append(4)\n",
    "    d.appendleft(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. ChainMap: A class for creating a single view of multiple mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from collections import ChainMap\n",
    "    dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "    dict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n",
    "    chain = ChainMap(dict1, dict2)\n",
